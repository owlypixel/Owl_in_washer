## What is this?
This project's purpose was to practice manipulating SVG elements using JavaScript. One particularly challenging thing was to create a glass door that you can open and close. I tried to create it using only CSS, but soon realized that it's not that easy and has very limited browser support, so decided to go with SVG. 
Another tricky moment was to synchronize all animations at certain points of time with the speech bubble. Spent about half of a day on that, but eventually it started working. 
You can play around and experiment with it [here](http://codepen.io/owlypixel/pen/XpzoGw) on CodePen. 
## What you'll learn from this
### JS
- Use Speech Synthesis API to make browser say some simple phrases
- Controlling CSS animations with JavaScript at certain points in time
- Adding and deleting classes for some elements on the page
- Understand setTimeout and setInterval functions
- Gracefully stop animation at the end of iteration, and not in the middle of it

### CSS
- Applying CSS animations to animate certain parts of an SVG image
- Creating cool background brick effect with heropatterns
- Creating interesting speech bubble animation
